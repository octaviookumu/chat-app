I had fun making this. It works but has a bug I experienced when importing Pusher. One bug being that it doesn't differentiate between two users chatting. So even if you're logged in as two users, all your messages will be displayed as that of only one user. I'll get back to fixing this when I have more time on my hands.



## How the process started
 - Migrations
 - Models
 - Controllers
 - Routes
 - Vue files
 - Setting up Pusher
